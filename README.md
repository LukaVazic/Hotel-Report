# Hotel Report
Data Analysis project.

# Built with
Power BI

# Goal
Build a dashboard in Power BI to present to stakeholders:
1. Is hotel revenue growing by year?
2. Should parking lot increase in size?
3. What trends can we see in data?

# Answering Questions
1. Hotel revenue experienced significant growth from 2018 to 2019 (over 300%). Then, it decreased from 2019 to 2020 by approximately 36%. 
2. There is no data to support increase in parking lot size.
3. We can see that average ADR, number of total nights, average discount, and total number of parking lots share trend to revenue.
